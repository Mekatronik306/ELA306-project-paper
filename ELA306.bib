In contrast, an electric vehicle (               EV               ) employs an electric motor for its powertrain. Differing from the               ICEV               powertrain that involves only the mechanical subsystem, the               EV               powertrain includes both the electrical subsystem and the mechanical subsystem. The electrical subsystem consists of the electronic controller, the power converter, and the electric motor, whereas the mechanical subsystem is the mechanical transmission. The variations in the electrical subsystem are mainly due to various types of electric motors and power converters adopted, whereas the variations in the mechanical subsystem mainly depend on various types of gearings and differentials selected. As there are many possible               EV               powertrain configurations, only those viable and representative configurations are discussed in this chapter, with emphasis on their basic principle and qualitative comparison.},

  abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are characterized by a significant variety of possible powertrain configurations, ranging from one to four electric machines, which can have an on-board or in-wheel layout. Multiple models of production EVs have recently been introduced on the market, with 4-wheel-drive (4WD) architectures based on a central motor within each axle, connected to the wheels through a gearbox, a differential, and half-shafts. In parallel, an important body of research and industrial demonstrations have covered the topic of 2-speed transmission systems for EVs, with the target of enhancing longitudinal acceleration and gradeability performance, while increasing the operating efficiency of the electric powertrain. Although several recent studies compare different electric powertrain architectures, to the best of the authors' knowledge the literature misses a comparison between 2-wheel-drive (2WD) and 4WD configurations for the same EV, from the viewpoint of drivability and energy consumption. This paper targets this gap, by assessing 2WD and 4WD powertrain layouts with central motors, for a case study light passenger car for urban mobility, including consideration of the effect of single- and 2-speed transmission systems. An optimization routine is used to calculate the energy-efficient gear state and/or torque distribution for each considered configuration. For the specific EV, the results highlight the favourable trade-off of the single-speed 4WD layout, capable of reducing the energy consumption during driving cycles by approximately 9\% with respect to the conventional 2WD layout with single-speed transmission, while providing satisfactory drivability and good gradeability, especially in low tire{\textendash}road friction conditions.},

  abstract = {As the automotive paradigm shifts towards electric, limited range remains a key challenge. Increasing the battery size adds weight, which yields diminishing returns in range per kilowatt-hour. Therefore, energy recovery systems, such as regenerative braking and photovoltaic cells, are desirable to recharge the onboard batteries in between hub charge cycles. While some reports of regenerative suspension do exist, they all harvest energy in a parasitic manner, and the predicted power output is extremely low, since the majority of the energy is still dissipated to the environment by the suspension. This paper proposes a fundamental suspension redesign using a magnetically-levitated spring mechanism and aims to increase the recoverable energy significantly by directly coupling an electromagnetic transducer as the main damper. Furthermore, the highly nonlinear magnetic restoring force can also potentially enhance rider comfort. Analytical and numerical models have been constructed. Road roughness data from an Australian road were used to numerically simulate a representative environment response. Simulation suggests that 10's of kW to {$>$}100 kW can theoretically be generated by a medium-sized car travelling on a typical paved road (about 2{\textendash}3 orders of magnitude higher than literature reports on parasitic regenerative suspension schemes), while still maintaining well below the discomfort threshold for passengers ({$<$}0.315 m/s     2     on average).},

Simulations are carried out, and the results show that the vehicle dynamic performances are effectively improved under different input conditions, including road surfaces and vehicle speeds. Furthermore, the energy-regenerative suspension can recover part of vibration energy, where the self-supply energy efficiency is about 55\% and the energy-regenerative efficiency is about 16\%. Meanwhile, the BP-PID algorithm also enables the suspension system's self-adaptability and stability characteristics on its energy recovery capability.},

Simulations are carried out using software Matlab/Simulink, and experiments are conducted on the B-class road. The results demonstrate that the variable universe fuzzy control can recycle more than 18 percent vibration energy and provide over 11 percent power for the control demand.

A PM type linear AC motor is used as an energy regenerative and active control suspension. This idea is applied to a quarter-car model and vibration control is performed. Energy regenerative and active control modes can not operate at the same time. A new control law is introduced to switch control modes and to follow the ideal force. The ideal force is calculated using the LQ control theory. The PWM switches are driven in proportion to the difference between the ideal control force and the actuator force using the modulation circuit.

  abstract = {Electric vehicles are becoming more popular in the market. To be competitive, manufacturers need to produce vehicles with a low energy consumption, a good range and an acceptable driving performance. These are dependent on the choice of components and the topology in which they are used. In a conventional gasoline vehicle, the powertrain topology is constrained to a few well-understood layouts; these typically consist of a single engine driving one axle or both axles through a multi-ratio gearbox. With electric vehicles, there is more flexibility, and the design space is relatively unexplored. In this paper, we evaluate several different topologies as follows: a traditional topology using a single electric motor driving a single axle with a fixed gear ratio; a topology using separate motors for the front axle and the rear axle, each with its own fixed gear ratio; a topology using in-wheel motors on a single axle; a four-wheel-drive topology using in-wheel motors on both axes. Multi-objective optimisation techniques are used to find the optimal component sizing for a given requirement set and to investigate the trade-offs between the energy consumption, the powertrain cost and the acceleration performance. The paper concludes with a discussion of the relative merits of the different topologies and their applicability to real-world passenger cars.},

  abstract = {Electric vehicles offer a promising solution to solving environmental problems related to air pollution. The typical powertrain design of an electric vehicle includes a relatively high-speed-low-torque electric motor integrated with some mechanical system to transmit the output mechanical energy to the wheels, such as the gearbox, transmission and differential. Different drivetrain configurations with single, double and quad electric motors can be used in electric vehicles. In this study, it is aimed to compare the effects of different powertrain configurations on the acceleration performance, range and energy consumption of the electric vehicle. Single, dual and quad motor electric vehicle powertrain systems were simulated with MATLAB Simulink according to the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). The Volvo XC40 Recharge electric car was used as the reference vehicle with the same vehicle characteristics, battery type/capacity and the same total power output by changing only the electric motor powertrain configurations. It has been determined that quadruple electric motor powertrain configuration has lower energy consumption, longer range and better acceleration performance than the single and double electric motor powertrain configurations.},
