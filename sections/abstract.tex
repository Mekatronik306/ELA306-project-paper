This study covers different configurations for electric vehicles and the development of a regenerative active suspension system for the MDH solar car. A quarter car model of the system was created and simulated in Simulink and Stateflow, together with a theoretical system design. The regenerative active suspension system maintained ride comfort, however the model provided unrealistic amounts of energy regenerated and consumed. The system did show sufficient promise to warrant further research efforts.
