\section{Conclusion}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The RASS system developed in this study provides a foundational proof of concept, presenting an initial demonstration of the viability and potential benefits of implementing a RASS for the MDH solar car, and other EVs. Although the study was constrained by the limitations of the study and the information available, it does show sufficient promise for further exploration and research efforts.
